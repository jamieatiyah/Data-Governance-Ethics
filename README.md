# Data-Governance-Ethics
A group report on the data governance and ethics of AI, focusing on the application PimEyes: a facial recognition platform where a user can upload any photo and is instantly presented with other photos from across the internet containing the face.

The aim of the report is to provide a clear illustration of the social, moral, cultural, environmental, legal, and ethical issues relating to the use of AI and to call attention to these issues within the context of PimEyes. The report reviewed current and emerging ethical guidelines, frameworks, principles, and legislation and assessed if such ethical practices were adhered to by PimEyes.

The report concluded that PimEyes was a major cause of public concern in its current state (as of January 2023).
